# RPS
This is the first part of the Rock-Paper-Scissors challenge of the Odin Project course. 
I will be returning to this project later to add CSS and apply my DOM Manipulation learning to it, as per the course.
Looking forward to it!

I have completed the project. In total, this took me 15h of work in two days to finish. 
I've tried to add my unique touch to the project through the basic story of saving the world, as I've seen many do, and also learned some basic CSS animations to make it look better.
I'm very satisfied with my progress and I'm sure there will be a lot more to come.
